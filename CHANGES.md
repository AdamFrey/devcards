## 0.2.0-5

* isolated more css into the addons css - thanks to magnars
* a new `:classname` option to the devcard options that will be added
to the card body - thanks to codebeige
* bumped React version to 0.13.3-1
* added base support for React 14 - thanks to minimal
* made `start-devcard-ui*` public
* a bunch of documentation has been added to rigsomelight.com/devcards

Note: I found out why Reagent has some rendering problems and I've
reported it https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/issues/195. I
don't want a hard dependency on Reagent so I'm going to need to wait
for that fix.

## 0.2.0-2 First documented release

* Support for `cljs.test` async testing
